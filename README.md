# python-ws-algo
Algorithm for Python speed analysis and alternatives benchmarking

## Ongoing progress
1. create dataset in CSV files
    * surface and weight of plates
    * compute for each plate
    * compute for plate families
2. create results with naive Pandas algorithm
3. code in SQL (SQLite)
4. code with Pandas optimized algorithm
5. code with Numpy arrays
6. code with pure Python objects (or dicts)
7. code with Cython
