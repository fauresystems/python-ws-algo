# python-ws-algo
Algorithm for Python speed analysis and alternatives benchmarking

## Ongoing progress
1. create dataset in SQLite3 file
    * width, length and weight of plates
    * compute surface and weight for each plate
    * compute average weight for plate families
2. create results with naive Pandas algorithm
3. code in SQL (SQLite)
4. code with Pandas optimized algorithm
5. code with Numpy arrays
6. code with pure Python objects (or dicts)
7. code with Cython
