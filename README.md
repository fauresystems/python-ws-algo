Algorithm for Python speed analysis and alternatives benchmarking

## Ongoing progress
1. create dataset in CSV files
    * surface and weight of plates
    * compute for each plate
    * compute for plate families
2. code in SQL (SQLite)
3. code with Pandas
4. code with Numpy arrays
5. code with pure Python objects (or dicts)
6. code with Cython
