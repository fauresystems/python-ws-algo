# python-ws-algo
Algorithm for Python speed analysis and alternatives benchmarking

## Ongoing progress
1. create dataset in SQLite3 file
    * width, length and weight of plates
    * distribute plates in families of length and density
    * compute surface and weight for each plate
    * compute average surface and weight for plate families
2. code in SQL (SQLite)
3. code with Pandas optimized algorithm
4. code with Numpy arrays
5. code with pure Python objects (or dicts)
6. code with Cython
